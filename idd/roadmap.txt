#Detailed Roadmap for Launching an AI Consulting Business
1. Positioning & Branding


Establish Credibility and a Unique Identity: The first step is to position yourself as a trustworthy AI expert with a clear value proposition. Define a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) that resonates with medium-sized companies - for example, 'Helping mid-market businesses achieve quick ROI from AI in 90 days'. Highlight any relevant credentials (industry experience, past projects, certifications) upfront to build instant trust.


Brand Consistency (Week 1): Create a cohesive brand image across all platforms. Design a clean logo and use consistent visuals/colors on your website, LinkedIn, and any brochures or PDFs. Even if bootstrapping, use free tools (Canva for design, templated site builders) to appear polished and established.
